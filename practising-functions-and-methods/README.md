# A collection of practice exercises focusing on the use of functions and methods.

## list_dot_method.py

This script is based on a challenge I found on Hackerrank. Even though the exercise itself is pretty basic
and not very original, at the time it really helped me understand how to work with functions and methods 
in contexts where they may need to be assigned to a variable.
